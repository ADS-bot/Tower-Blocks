<h1>Tower Blocks Game</h1>
This is a tower blocks game built using Three.js, Tween.js, Physics.js, and GSAP for animations. The game allows players to stack blocks on top of each other to build the tallest tower possible. The blocks fall from the sky, and the player needs to time their placement accurately to ensure the tower remains stable.<br>
